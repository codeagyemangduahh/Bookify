# Bookify

Jen is a book lover who has long been frustrated by the challenge of keeping track of her ever-growing library. She registers for Achiaah's Book Collection to help manage her books. After registering, she immediately finds herself immersed in a user-friendly interface that effortlessly guides her through adding her entire collection. With each book she logs, Jen feels a sense of relief and satisfaction as her personal library transforms from a chaotic stack of titles into an organized and accessible digital archive. The seamless process of viewing, editing, and categorizing her books brings a newfound joy to her reading experience, allowing her to focus on her love for literature rather than the logistics of managing her collection.

The Book Collection project aims to create a comprehensive web application for creating a personal book collection. This application will provide CRUD functionalities allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete books from the collection. The purpose of the project is to improve user experience, and provide an efficient platform for users.
